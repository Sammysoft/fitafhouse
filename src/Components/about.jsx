          <b>First International Trade and Finance House Ltd</b> also known as
          FITAFHOUSE in business parlance opened her door to the public in
          Nigeria on the 26th March, 1984. Similarly, the company opened her
          door for patronage in Wales in United Kingdom on the 18th May, 1989
          though very short-lived. The company started here in Benin City before
          relocating to Akure, Ondo State in 1993.
          <br />
          Generally, Finance Companies (FC) in Nigeria witnessed crisis in the
          early nineties because of lack of understanding of the operation of
          the industry. For example, many finance company operators invested
          short term fund placement for long term projects. Some also paid
          upfront interest for fund placement. Ninety percent of the finance
          companies in Nigeria during this crisis went under. In spite of the
          crisis First International Trade and Finance House Ltd survived it.
          The brand continued to wax strong till today not because we are
          perfect but because of the mercy of God and His grace.
          <br />
          In the early twenties another crisis came up through investing in
          stock exchange in Nigeria, hundreds of companies somersaulted but
          First International Trade and Finance House Ltd lost money but
          overcame the troubled water by dint of hardwork and prayer. After this
          crisis, most of our money had to be invested in landed properties. The
          good thing at the end of the crisis was that we did not have any
          customer that we were indebted to. <br />
          <br />
          The third crisis came in 2019 when COVID 19 kept almost every person
          at home. In real term the economy was upside down and the situation
          was devastating. First International Trade and Finance House Ltd
          delibrately closed her door to the public and operate from closed
          door. Business was really bad!. Finance Company has a bright future in
          Nigeria if it is well managed and supported by friends and well
          wishers. When we consider the operation of commercial banks in
          Nigeria, we could come to term with reality that their operation is
          too conservative and this does not encourage young entrepreneur which
          of cours are the heartbeat of any economy. China is a reference point.
          The microfinance bank that came into existence because of the pulic
          cry did not solve any problem. This is because most of their managers
          were at one time or the other official in the commercial bank. Some of
          them are wounded officers in the bank who sees opportunity to be extra
          careful in their duties when employed in a microfinance bank. The
          attitude of some Nigerian towards borrowing is nothing to write home
          about. Most of the banks lord over their custmers as if they are not
          partners in progress. Again most of the policies of the banks are
          straight jacket. None of the operators can use their initiative. But
          then this approach was due to abuse of power by the bank officials in
          the past.

          This is where finance company comes in. First International Trade and
          Finance House Ltd package is very clear. For example, we decide
          whether to finance or not from appraising report of a project,
          investment etc. We raise money for the qualified ones through the
          instrumentality of equity, debt and grant funding. We also go ahead to
          appoint credible officer to suppervise the execution of the project,
          investment etc. The good thing about this approach is that it is
          beautiful and most of the time is error-free.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our door is opened to all and sundries to test whether their
          project/investment etc is viable or not . The assurance we have for
          any of our clients is that once a project/investment is viable
          according to FITAFHOUSE conditionalities funding of the project is
          assured. Our association with our bank is very cordial. In fact, some
          of the projects are vetted by them and we get assistance from them
          when we knock at their door. This is the procedure of finance company
          operations in most of the developed countries of the world
          <br />
          <br />
          The future of our company is very bright because of our strategy of
          doing our business. We are not chewing more than we can bite. For
          example, we hire to appraise and execute. We also hire for marketing.
          We have a minimal overhead and this has been our survival strategy.
          <br />
